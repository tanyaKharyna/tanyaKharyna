<h1>👋 Hi there </h1><br>
🏷 My name is Tanya and I am a Software Tester. My primary focus is the testing of web applications in Agile environments. I enjoy automating test cases, but also love to do exploratory testing and "breaking" software🐛 <br>
✏️ Use JavaScript/ TypeScript for test automation<br>
🧠 Currently trying to become better at TestOps, learning React<br>
🖥  On a mission to create a test automation portfolio<br>
🙋 In my spare time, I try to build a social life in Stockholm, where I recently I moved in September 2020. I like meeting new people, so if you’re reading this then I’d love to meet if we’re in the same city!<br>
